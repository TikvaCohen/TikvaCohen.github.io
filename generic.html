									<h1>A Brief History of <br />
									Tikva Cohen</h1>
									<p>Hello! My name is Tikva Cohen and I have recently graduated with a M.A. in Literature. I have professional and educational experience in research, presenting, editing, databases, video production, customer service, and teaching. I am comfortable writing and presenting to different levels of familiarity. I have created an introductory college course on monsters, wrote the first draft of a journal article, and completed a graduate paper explaining how retellings of the creation myth in children’s fantasy helped create female gender norms. I have experience in wielding analytical, creative, and communication skills to reach objectives. I am a proactive problem-solver who works well both individually and with a team.  I am interested in a lasting career where I can learn new skills and take on leadership roles.  </p>

								<p>By the age of seven the local librarians knew me by name.   This wasn’t surprising as I was always in their space asking questions, getting recommendations, and learning everything I could about whatever was in front of me.  Not much changed.  Interested from one subject to another I went to a charter high school called High Tech High Media Arts, which focused on presentations and project-based learning.  In college at the University of California San Diego, I majored in Anthropology while taking enough outside courses I received two minors in different areas of Literature.  Professionally I interned at W.W. Norton Publishing Inc. in their editorial department, worked for a consulting agency researching and writing published journal articles and reference books, all while running a small side business helping businesses and households.  When my need to study more reached another fever pitch, I went back to receive my M.A. in Literature at San Diego State University.  While being a full-time student I worked as a Rhetoric and Writing Fellow and an Instructional Student Assistant, helping students learn how to write convincing arguments and grading their efforts.  This culminated in becoming a Teaching Assistant, allowing me to research, develop, and teach my own course.  This occurred during the pandemic and I was so motivated to fulfill my responsibilities that I created supplemental videos on my own time to help students.  (I was later told to stop because I was raising the standard of expectations too high for other teachers).  </p>
								<p>My goal is simply to be able to keep learning.  I love analyzing information and enjoy presenting that information to others.  Whether it be to other professionals in journal articles or to beginners through lectures, graphs, and videos, I remain as devoted as I was while pestering librarians.  </p>
								<p>My personality is easy-going.  While I might be focused on a goal, I am more than happy to collaborate with others.  I’m delighted to learn about my coworkers and am happy to share my interests.  I’m a fan of indie cartoons, fantasy books, and cozy mystery shows.  My next goal for my hobbies is to learn to sew historical costumes.  Feel free to message me to talk about new opportunities or nerdy interests! </p>
